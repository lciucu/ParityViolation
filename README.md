Report for a one year-long laboraty of experimental particle physics at the masters program at the University of Geneva, with partner Ana Ventura Barroso, that awarded me 15 ECTS. The research topic is the experimental observation of the CP violation (matter-antimatter asymmetry).

* [Report](./Report/Report.pdf).

The repo contains also the Python code to create the asymmetry plots.
